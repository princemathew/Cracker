## Code testing & editing

1. To edit and test code you should have nodejs installed in your system
```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -  

sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
2. Goto the project folder in terminal, then execute following commands
 * ```npm install```
 * In windows
    ```.\node_modules\.bin\electron-rebuild.cmd```

   In ubuntu
    ```./node_modules/.bin/electron-rebuild```
 * ```npm start```


## Building executables

I used electron-builder, I had some issues while building : windows installer from ubuntu and ubuntu installer from windows.
